## Why Hackshops?
### Learn Lean by Being Lean 
Hackshops apply lean principles to hackathons. By using the Hackshop format, hackathon teams can expect to learn:
- how to maximize resources in hyper-limited time constraints
- how to validate with customers before building the wrong thing
- how to document a brief, living, and lean business model
- how to continually test assumptions with rapid experimentation to deliver an MVP


Hackshops are still hackathons. The difference is the addition of the Hackshop framework for running in a lean way, to be as efficient as possible, focused on continuously experimenting and learning throughout the development process. 
### The Traditional Hackathon
Hackathons traditionally center around building solutions, the most time-consuming and expensive part of the development lifecycle. 

Individuals and teams show up to the event already knowing what they plan to build. Sometimes, problem statements are pre-defined, which is a step in the right direction -- but what if you're not passionate about the problem to be solved? Or what if you already have an amazing solution in mind?

Unfortunately, your amazing solution is probably not actually as amazing as you think. You may have even skipped identifying what the underlying problem is altogether. You could spend 24 hours coding a chat app for retired seniors only to find out that 10% of them use smart phones.

### The Hackshop Way 
Hackshops focus on problems and customers first. What problem are you solving and for who are you solving it? Can you make a compelling promise to that customer that you can deliver a solution that meets their needs? Before we even talk about solutions, we focus on the customer, problem, and promise, first. 

We've learned that when starting with a problem or an idea, the more we can be wrong, faster, the more we can get to a solution worth building. This approach sounds backwards, because your solution is so obviously brilliant, right? Unfortunately, probably not. Solutions that go from idea to launch without any attempt to validate or invalidate the underlying problem with a customer segment and if your solution fits their needs are rarely successful. 

The Hackshop format leaves the traditional hackathon's solution-centric format behind. Hackshops focus on customers, problems, and promises first, and advocate moving quickly using succinct timeboxes to get from idea to MVP as quickly as possible. Throughout the event, teams work to prove their own assumptions wrong on their path to a viable solution.

## Hackshops vs. Hackathons
### 5 Unique Elements
- problem-centric approach (no solutions for the first 1/4 of the event) 
- use of a [lean business canvas](resources/leancanvas.pdf) as central to process
- customer validation before building 
- rapid prototyping and experimentation
- use of continuous feedback loop (frame/build/measure/learn) 

### Recommended (Lightweight) Tooling
- An electronic or paper version of a [lean business canvas](resources/leancanvas.pdf)
- GitHub, for collaboration on code and issues
- [hackshop.waffle.io](https://hackshop.waffle.io), a pre-built project template for managing issues in GitHub using a lean workflow
- [Slack](http://slack.com), for remote and ongoing communications (optional) 

### Hackshops specifically limit risk around: 
- solving problems that aren't painful or impactful
- building the wrong thing for the wrong customer
- post-hackathon death due to lack of focus or centralization of team/data
